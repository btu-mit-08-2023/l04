=== verse-1 ===
Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word

=== pre-chorus-1 ===
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

=== chorus-1 ===
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

=== post-chorus-1 ===

=== verse-2 ===
I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift, I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end

=== pre-chorus-2 ===
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

=== chorus-2 ===
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

=== post-chorus-2 ===
Yeah, hey, yay

=== verse-3 ===
And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, it's hard to find
Oh well, whatever, never mind

=== pre-chorus-3 ===
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

=== chorus-3 ===

=== outro-3 ===
A denial, a denial
A denial, a denial
A denial, a denial
A denial, a denial
A denial
